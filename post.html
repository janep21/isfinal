                        <p>A lot of people think that where you should go on Oahu is Waikiki, but don’t be fooled this is the WORST place to go. Only go if you are surfing in the summer and want to watch the fireworks on Friday night. Where you will want to go is North Shore </p>
                        <p>The first recommendation is to go to sharks cove where there are so many caves and fish to find. A common cave to dive is called the blue room because the light reflects into the water making it the clearest bright water you have ever seen.  </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://mediaim.expedia.com/localexpert/205744/708cea22-c9ec-4e3d-85bd-be6384cc21c0.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted"> Sharks cove- warning this is not actually sharks cove!! there are no sharks there!!</span>
                        <p>Another great place to snorkel is electric beach, or waimea beach. There you can also cliff jump and you may find dolphins.</p>
                       <h2 class="section-heading">Beaches</h2>
                        <p> One of the best beaches on the whole entire island is Kekis Beach. Its a secret beach that only locals know about, and it by far has the clearest water and whitest sand you will ever see. There is always a volleyball game there that you can join. </p>
                        <p> It is advised to be careful in the winter when visiting kekis beach beacuse the ways get up to ten feet tall. If you are bad at swimming like me this could be dangerous, so wear some kind of floatation devise!! No one will think you look THAT werid.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://onlyinhawaii.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ke-Iki-Beach-Haleiwa-Hawaii.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted"> Keikis beach, dont look like a tourist or someone will glare</span>
                       <blockquote class="blockquote">“Be a pineapple: Stand tall, wear a crown, and be sweet on the inside.” <br> - Queen Elizabeth</blockquote>
                        <p>Another good but popular one is waimea beach. This one has cliff jumping! Bonus points if you can do a flip, lots of the time people will clap just beacause. The children here are mean but the turtles are nice. No surf. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Fun Facts</h2>
                        <p>Be careful of hoe the tides go in and out because it can make places unsafe. The times for safety are as follows: “4:00, wallow in self-pity. 4:30, stare into the abyss. 5:00, solve world hunger, tell no one. 5:30, jazzercize; 6:30, dinner with me. I can't cancel that again. 7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing. I'm booked. Of course, if I bump the loathing to 9, I could still be done in time to lay in bed, stare at the ceiling and slip slowly into madness."</p>

                        <p> Hawaii is a great place filled with a lot of fun people, lots of laughs to be had. Lots of adventiures to be had, and lots of memories to be made. Make sure to be consious of the locals and respect the land. You dont want to look out of place.</p>
